# calculator
This is a calculator that runs on a webpage using nothing but JavaScript.
Enter a number using the on-screen keypad, then choose an operator. Enter a second number using the 
on-screen keypad, and then press the Equals button. The calculator will display the result of your first
number being operated with your chosen operator by your second number. 

The calculator allows the user to input decimal numbers, as well as returns decimal numbers when a number is divided with a remainder. If you accidentally select the incorrect operator button, simply select the correct operator button instead. The 'CE' button clears the display on click, and will clear all stored variables (similar to the C button) on a second click.
